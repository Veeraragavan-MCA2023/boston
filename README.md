# boston
The JavaScript code starts by importing the "boston" data from another file called "boston.js".

This program imports data from "boston.js," sorts it based on the values in the 11th column in descending order, and displays the top 5 rows of sorted data with columns 8 and 11 on a web page inside the

element with the id "app."
